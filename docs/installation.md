# Installation

## On Linux 

On Debian based operating systems (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint) download and install the deb package. On desktop versions, open package and click `install package`. 

For automatic installation on Linux, download the source code from the releases section, extract the tar and change directory to the build directory, then run:

	sh INSTALL_LINUX.sh

Test install. Run:

	dfg -version

Done.

To skip installer, and copy as a stand-alone executable, extract the contents and copy dfg.bin anywhere you desire. Make executable with command:  

	chmod +x dfg.bin 


And run: 
 

	./dfg.bin
