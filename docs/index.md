## About

DEFIANT-FG is a powerful, light-weight, open source, command line tool to monitor for corruption, changes or missing files in a directory structure.

It's your ideal companion to monitor cold backups and archival data on external media. Plug your external hard drive in periodically and test that the data the drive is giving you is correct.

Helps detect bitrot and early signs of media failure.
