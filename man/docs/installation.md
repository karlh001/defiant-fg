# Installation
## On Linux 

 

For automatic installation on Linux, extract the archive (dfg_linux_stable.tar) and run install.sh as root. 

 

Alternatively, install manually: 

 

	cd ~/Downloads 

	wget http://karlhunter.co.uk/defiant/downloads/	dfg_linux_stable.tar 

	tar -XYZ dfg_linux.tar 

	cp  

 

As standalone executable, extract the contents and copy dfg.bin anywhere you desire. Make executable with command: 

 

	chmod +x dfg.bin 

 

And run: 

 

	./dfg.bin
